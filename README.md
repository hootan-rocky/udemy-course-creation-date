# Course Creation Date Finder on Udemy

On the Udemy website, there is no information on the creation date of a course.
Despite the fact that the course was last updated, its age and the fact that the upgrade was so minimal may mean that it is no longer useful.
When you are on the course page, this extension displays the creation date of the courses.
